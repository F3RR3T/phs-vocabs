# The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE) Vocabularies

This repository contains the source files of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE) [public vocabularies](http://dawe.surroundaustralia.com/). *This is an interim site*.

In the first instance, we are focussing on vocabularies for the [Plant health Surveillance Ontology](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/phs).

These vocabularies are presented as [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) vocabularies. This is the same framework that is in use by other Australian Government and state governement agencies, which are planned to be delivered online by a consolidated server.
